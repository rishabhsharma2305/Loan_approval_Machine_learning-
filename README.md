# Loan_approval_Machine_learning-
predict whether a loan is safe or risky 

Data set- Loan.csv
This data set consist of data of 615 people with 11 inputs and output. 

notebook- ML algorithms to decide whether a loan application is safe or risky. 
Data preprocessing- 
1. Examine the data and filling out null values. 
2. One-hot Encoding to convert all string data into integer one so that grphs could be plotted

Automating stuff
Pipelines for bringing data in a standard rate and adjustig null values in future by machine itself

Train-test split
splittind dataset in 2 sub sets so that our algorithm can learn on one of the set and work on other

Algorithms
1. logistic regression
2. decision tree

Accuracy
1. Mean squared error
2. confusion matrix
logistic model is more accurate than decision tree model
